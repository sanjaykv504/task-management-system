# Task Management System API
 
A Laravel-based API for managing tasks, where users can create, assign, and mark tasks as completed. This project demonstrates key Laravel concepts including authentication, queues, middleware, dependency injection, and task scheduling.
 
## Features
 
- **User Authentication:**
- Registration and login using Laravel Sanctum.
- Only authenticated users can create and assign tasks.
 
- **Task Management API:**
- **Create Task:** POST /api/tasks
- **Assign Task:** PUT /api/tasks/{id}/assign
- **Complete Task:** PUT /api/tasks/{id}/complete
- **List Tasks:** GET /api/tasks (with optional filters for status, assigned user, etc.)
 
- **Queues & Jobs:**
- Dispatches a job to send an email notification when a task is assigned.
- Uses Laravel's database queue driver for asynchronous processing.
 
- **Custom Middleware:**
- Logs request execution time to storage/logs/laravel.log.
- Applied to all API routes.
 
- **Scheduler:**
- A custom command runs every hour to check for overdue tasks.
- Automatically marks tasks as "expired" if their due date has passed and they are still pending.
